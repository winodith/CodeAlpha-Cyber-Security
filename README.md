# Secure Coding Review Report for SQL Injection Vulnerability

## Review Type: Manual Secure Code Review  

---

## Overview  
A security review was conducted on the initial login system implemented using Flask and SQLite3. The goal was to identify potential security vulnerabilities and recommend best practices to improve the system's security.  

---

## Identified Security Risks  

### 1. SQL Injection Vulnerability  
- The initial code directly incorporated user input into an SQL query using string formatting:  
  ```python
  f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '{username}' AND password = '{password}'"
  ```
- This allows **SQL injection attacks**, where an attacker can manipulate the query to gain unauthorized access.  

### 2. Plaintext Password Storage  
- The database stored passwords in **plain text**, making them readable in case of a data breach.  
- This violates best security practices and makes user credentials highly vulnerable.  

### 3. Exposure of Credentials in URL (GET Request Issue)  
- The login endpoint retrieved user credentials using a **GET request** (`request.args.get()`), exposing passwords in URLs, logs, and browser history.  
- Attackers monitoring network traffic (**MITM attacks**) can steal credentials easily.  

### 4. Lack of Response Security  
- The system returned simple text messages (`"Login successful"` or `"Login failed"`), which could be misused in **brute-force attacks**.  
- The response structure also lacked proper error handling.

## Recommendations for Secure Coding Practices  

### ✅ Use Parameterized Queries  
- Prevents **SQL injection** by safely handling user inputs.  
- **Corrected code example:**  
  ```python
  @app.route('/login', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
  def login():
      username = request.args.get('username')
      password = request.args.get('password')
      conn = sqlite3.connect('example.db')
      c = conn.cursor()
      
      query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ? AND password = ?"
      print("Executing query with parameters:", query, (username, password))  
      c.execute(query, (username, password))  # Secure parameterized query
  
      result = c.fetchone()
      conn.close()
      
      if result:
          return "Login successful"
      else:
          return "Login failed"
  ```

### ✅ Implement Password Hashing  
- Store passwords securely using **bcrypt** or **PBKDF2** instead of plain text.  
- **Example (hashing a password before storage):**  
  ```python
  import bcrypt
  hashed_password = bcrypt.hashpw(password.encode(), bcrypt.gensalt())
  ```

### ✅ Use POST Requests for Login  
- Prevents credential exposure in URLs by using `request.form.get('username')` instead of `request.args.get()`.  
- **Example:**  
  ```python
  username = request.form.get('username')
  password = request.form.get('password')
  ```

### ✅ Enhance Response Security  
- Return **JSON responses** instead of plain text for better security and structured data handling.  
- **Example:**  
  ```python
  from flask import jsonify
  return jsonify({"message": "Login successful"})
  ```

### ✅ Rate Limiting & Logging  
- Implement **rate limiting** to prevent brute-force attacks.  
- Use **logging & monitoring** to detect unusual login attempts.  

---

## Conclusion  
The initial code contained critical security vulnerabilities, including **SQL injection risks, plaintext password storage, and exposure of credentials in URLs**. By implementing **parameterized queries, password hashing, POST requests, and structured responses**, the security of the system can be significantly improved. These changes align with **industry best practices** for secure web application development.
